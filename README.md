# calenderprintings
A calendar is a system of organizing days. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. It will print the calender by giving the input of year.
we have used a lot of funtions to print the calender - firstly we have made function for checking leap year and another functions for checking date is valid or not and difference between dates and then we have used the function to print days name. 
Made Under the guidance of Champak Roy Sir.
