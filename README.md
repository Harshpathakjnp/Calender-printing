# calenderprintings
A calendar is a system of organizing days. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. It will print the calender by giving the input of year.
we have used a lot of funtions to print the calender - firstly we have made function for checking leap year and another functions for checking date is valid or not and difference between dates and then we have used the function to print days name.
leap year function is for checking leap year. when you will give the input of any year then it will check the year that weather that day is leap year (366 days) or not .
isdatevalid function is used for checking the given date is correct or not . if year is less than 0 then it will print invali else it will print the valid .
gapBetweenDates function is used for knowing the gap between two given dates, in this the program will print number of gap or number of days are there in these two dates.
